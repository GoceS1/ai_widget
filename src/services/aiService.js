**Guidelines:**
- Improve sentence structure for better rhythm and impact.
- Replace weak or vague words with more precise and powerful alternatives.
- Ensure smooth transitions between ideas.

**Constraints:**

**Guidelines:**
- Replace casual language, slang, colloquialisms, and overly familiar expressions with standard professional vocabulary.
- Eliminate contractions (e.g., rewrite "don't" as "do not," "it's" as "it is").
- Rephrase sentences to be more formal, clear, and respectful.
- Ensure the final text projects competence and authority.

**Constraints:**
- You must retain the core meaning and all critical information from the original text. The goal is a change in tone, not content.

- Only make the minimum changes necessary to correct objective errors. If a sentence is grammatically correct but sounds awkward, you must leave it unchanged.
- Do not alter the author's vocabulary or sentence structure unless it is grammatically incorrect.
- Your output must ONLY be the corrected text. Do not include any notes, explanations, or conversational phrases.`,

Subject: Re: ETOA Member | Your guides in Norway
Hi [Name],

Just following up on my note from last week.

For many in your role, the process of finding, vetting, and managing individual local guides involves a lot of scattered emails and spreadsheets. Our goal is to consolidate that entire workflow into one reliable platform.

Wondering if this is a challenge your team is currently facing?

Best,

Hi [Name],

Thank you for your reply and interestâ€”we're glad the email found its way to the right person.

Next week works perfectly for us. Our CEO, Nick Gray, and possibly our CMO, Karin, will be joining me for the discussion.

To make scheduling easy, you can find a time that works for you directly on our leadership team's partnership calendar:
[Booking Link]

We look forward to connecting and learning more about [Their Company Name].

Hi [Name],

That's great, thank you for booking. September 1st at 12:00 PM UK time works perfectly for us.

I've just updated the calendar invitation and have added [Colleague's Name]. She should receive the updated invitation shortly.

We're looking forward to speaking with you both then.
